Config file parsing for C++
===========================

This was written for mineserver (http://mineserver.be/) but is generic enough
that it might be useful for other people too. There's a somewhat nifty lexer
and parser that's easy enough to understand, so it might also do well for a
learning aid of some kind if you want to know how a simple parser works.

There's still a lot lacking in this, but it might be updated at some point.
I'll try to keep any changes made in mineserver backported to this repository.

Probably github is easiest for this. You might find me in #mineserver on
irc.esper.net as well if you want some kind of real-time response. That is if
I'm not sleeping at the time (or pretending to sleep). If you want to send me
email, decode the following text using base64:
